# Car-rental-database
This Python program will run a simple database for a car rental company. It is easy to use with all the necessary  information
needed to use the program being printed in console as you go along.

It uses an sqlite3 database, and if the database doesn't already exist it will create one with the necessary tables for 
you.

When starting the program for the first time you can import the examples in the import folder to
populate the database with a few entries for testing.

Modules used: 
* sqlite3
* re
* csv
* json
* os.path
* datetime
* textwrap
* sys

Note: this was a project for my first Python class and is therefore experimental and not production ready.
